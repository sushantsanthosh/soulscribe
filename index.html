                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>At SoulScribe, we're more than just a team—we're survivors and warriors of our own mental health battles. Throughout high school, the three of us witnessed firsthand the pain and struggles that mental health issues can cause, not only in ourselves but in our friends and loved ones. We know what it's like to feel isolated, misunderstood, and overwhelmed. That's why we couldn't stand by any longer. We felt a responsibility to take action, to turn our shared experiences into something positive and supportive. This website is our heartfelt effort to reach out to those who are struggling, to let you know that you're not alone, and to provide the resources and support that we wish we had. Together, we can face these challenges and find strength in our shared journey.</p>
